# ImageBlocker
Image Download Blocker
This Javascript script block image downlaod.
You can't download it with extension or using "save image as"

How It works:

1. Converting images to canvas.
2. Blocking canvas download.
3. Removing images meta-data.

How to use it:

Downlaod this script and add it to your page using <script src="ImageBlocker" ><script>

OR

Add <script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SjomaNikitin/image-download-blocker/main/ImageBlocker.js" ><script> to your script

Deficiencies:

1. Doesn't istantly work with (loading = "lazy") images
2. It's posible to download image from inspector.
